# Urban Heat Island (UHI) Prediction Model - NYC Bronx & Manhattan

## üèÜ 3rd Place Solution on EY Urban Heat Island Competition Leaderboard

This repository contains my solution for modeling and predicting the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in New York City's Bronx and Manhattan regions. The model achieved a leaderboard score of 0.9837, securing 3rd place in the competition and earning recognition as a global semi-finalist by the organizers.

## Project Overview

The Urban Heat Island effect refers to the phenomenon where urban areas experience significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas due to human activities and urban infrastructure like buildings concrete absorbing more heat compared to the rural part where the vegetation and trees ratio is much higher. This project leverages multiple satellite and urban datasets to create a robust predictive model of UHI intensity.

## Datasets

The solution integrates a diverse range of datasets to capture the complex factors driving urban heat:

- **Satellite Data**: Landsat thermal bands and Sentinel-2 imagery
- **Urban Infrastructure**: NYC Building Footprints, Tree Census, Traffic data
- **Environmental Factors**: Elevation points, forestry data, weather measurements
- **Network Analysis**: OSMNX street networks for connectivity metrics

## Methodology

### Data Processing
- Generated 1,700+ features from multiple datasets
- Created spatial buffer analyses (500m-15,000m) to capture geographic relationships
- Implemented temporal aggregation techniques to ensure model stability
- Null values in buffer-based features were imputed with 0 to reflect absence of structures or vegetation

## Key Factors

1. **Satellite Data Resampling**
   - Implemented bilinear resampling of 10m Sentinel-2 data to 30m resolution
   - This technique effectively removed noise while preserving important spatial patterns (similar to an autoencoder)
   - Compared with other resampling methods, bilinear resampling yielded significant CV and LB improvements

2. **Weather Data Temporal Alignment**
   - Solved critical temporal misalignment between training data (timeframes 3-4) and weather data (timeframes 6-20)
   - Developed linear time compression algorithm to map weather data to training timeframes
   - Validated multiple window sizes to optimize temporal matching
   - Mapped closest temporal weather measurements to training observations

3. **Spatial Imputation for Test Data**
   - Addressed missing time data in the test set using innovative spatial imputation techniques
   - Applied nearest neighbor spatial joins to impute weather data values
   - Created a two-step imputation process: temporal alignment for training data, followed by spatial imputation for test data

4. **Advanced Buffer Analysis**
   - Implemented both standard and annular (ring) buffers at multiple scales (500m-15,000m)
   - This approach captured spatial relationships at different distances without requiring explicit coordinates
   - Generated powerful features for urban heat drivers at increasing distances from measurement points

### Feature Engineering
- Developed specialized features capturing building-vegetation interactions
- Created thermal mass indicators and vertical density metrics
- Engineered elevation gradients and building height dispersion ratios
- Both non-linear and domain-friendly features created for diverse impact.
- Used RFECV to select optimal features (60 for single model, ~220 for ensemble)

### Model Architecture

#### Single Model Approach
- Extra Trees Regressor optimized with Optuna
- Parameters: `ExtraTreesRegressor(n_estimators=200, max_depth=55)`
- CV/LB score: 0.9824

#### Ensemble Solution
- 27 diverse Extra Trees Regressors:
  - 24 ETRs trained on unscaled Dataset A (220 features)
  - 3 ETRs trained on Standard-Scaled Dataset B (221 features)
- Meta-learner: Ridge regression with polynomial kernel
  - Parameters: `KernelRidge(alpha=0.00001, kernel='poly', degree=2, coef0=0.25)`
- 10-fold Out-of-Fold (OOF) validation framework
- Leaderboard score: 0.9837

## Results

The final ensemble model achieved:
- Leaderboard score: 0.9837
- Competition ranking: 3rd place
- Recognition: Global Semi-Finalist

## Key Insights

The model revealed important relationships between urban heat intensity and:
- Vegetation coverage (particularly EVI from Sentinel-2)
- Building density and height profiles
- Street network configuration
- Tree canopy characteristics
